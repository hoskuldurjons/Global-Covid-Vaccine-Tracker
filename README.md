# Global-Covid-Vaccine-Tracker

In this project I worked with global covid-19 vaccine dataset from ourworldindata.org. The dataset timeline covers the end of 2020 into April 2023, the visualization is not dynmically updated for dates after the 6th of April 2023.

The Tableau visualization showcases interesting vaccine progress information which can be filtered for specific date timelines, continents and/or countries. All of the informative fields will only show data based on the selected date and location filters at the top.

First you will see a numerical breakdown of people partly vaccinated, fully vaccinated and the share of people not vaccinated at all. Next there is a descending bar chart breaking down the numerical information by location.

Following those fields you will be presented with a map which you can hover over to see specific data for the countries or continents selected and finally how GDP per capita affects vaccination rates.

Note that Gibraltar is an outlier in the dataset, the country has an estimated population of 34.003 but had administered 132.810 doses of vaccine on the 16th of December 2022.
