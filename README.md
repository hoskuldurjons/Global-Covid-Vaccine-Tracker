# Global-Covid-Vaccine-Tracker

The Global Vaccine Tracker Tableau visualization is an interactive tool that displays COVID-19 vaccination progress worldwide. The visualization draws data from the Our World in Data COVID-19 Vaccination Dataset and allows users to select a start and end date from January 1st, 2020 to April 8th, 2023, as well as filter by continent and/or country.

The main question answered by this visualization is, "What share of the population has been partly or fully vaccinated?" The data reveals that 5,573,184,290 people have been partially vaccinated against COVID-19, 5,142,182,689 people are fully vaccinated, and 30.12% of the population has not been vaccinated at all.

The visualization presents a horizontal bar chart displaying the vaccination status of each country in the world, with the blue part indicating the share of people who are fully vaccinated and the smaller yellow part representing the share of people who are partially vaccinated.

Below the bar chart is an interactive world map that shows a tooltip with information on each country on mouse over. The map displays countries with less vaccination in lighter shades of blue, while countries with a higher vaccination rate are shown in darker shades of blue.

Finally, a dot graph displays each country as a dot, with the y-axis representing people vaccinated per hundred and the x-axis representing the country's GDP per capita. Overall, this visualization provides a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 vaccination progress around the world.
